Configuration system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    In Mbed OS 6 the list of supported boards was heavily reduced, only officially
    supported and well maintained targets left. More information in
    `the official explanation <https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Increase-the-quality-of-platform-support/>`_.
    In order to keep legacy projects built on top of Mbed OS 5 compilable, each
    development platform contains a list of deprecated boards that is used to dynamically
    select the proper version of Mbed OS (OS5 or OS6).

PlatformIO allows you to customize mbed OS compile time configuration
parameters using ``mbed_app.json`` manifest. It should be placed into the root
of your project and located on the same level as :ref:`projectconf`.

Configuration is defined using `JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_.
Some examples of configuration parameters:

* The sampling period for a data acquisition application.
* The default stack size for a newly created OS thread.
* The receive buffer size of a serial communication library.
* The flash and RAM memory size of a target board.

See more details in the official `ARM Mbed OS Configuration System <https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.11/reference/configuration.html>`_.

A few PlatformIO-ready projects based on ARM mbed OS which use ``mbed_app.json``:

* `Freescale Kinetis: mbed-rtos-kvstore <https://github.com/platformio/platform-freescalekinetis/tree/develop/examples/mbed-rtos-kvstore>`_
* `ST STM32: mbed-rtos-mesh-minimal <https://github.com/platformio/platform-ststm32/tree/develop/examples/mbed-rtos-mesh-minimal>`_

.. warning::

    On Windows the maximum length for a path (file name and directory route, also
    known as ``MAX_PATH``) â€” has been defined by 260 characters which can lead to
    compilation error for some targets. It's possible to shorten these paths is to
    install packages in root of any logical disk by specifying :ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`.


Mbed OS 6
^^^^^^^^^

Using Bare Metal profile
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The bare metal profile implements a subset of Mbed OS's RTOS APIs that are useful in
non-threaded applications, such as semaphores (calling the release API from interrupts)
and tickers (to set up a recurring interrupt). It does not include an RTX, and is
therefore suitable for applications that do not require complex thread management.
Instead of the RTOS's scheduler, all activities are polled or interrupt-driven.

Useful links:

* `Detailed description of bare metal profile <https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.2/bare-metal/index.html>`_
* `Porting a target from Mbed OS 2 to Mbed OS 6 bare metal <https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.2/bare-metal/porting-a-target-from-mbed-os-2-to-mbed-os-6-bare-metal.html>`_


Mbed OS 5 and Mbed 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PlatformIO allows compiling projects with or without Mbed OS 5. By default, project
is built without the OS feature. Most of the framework functionality requires the OS to
be enabled. To add the OS feature you can use a special macro definition that needs be
added to :ref:`projectconf_build_flags` of :ref:`projectconf`:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Name
      - Description

    * - ``PIO_FRAMEWORK_MBED_RTOS_PRESENT``
      - Build the project with enabled ``rtos``

An example of :ref:`projectconf` with enabled ``rtos``

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:wizwiki_w7500p]
    platform = wiznet7500
    framework = mbed
    board = wizwiki_w7500p
    build_flags = -D PIO_FRAMEWORK_MBED_RTOS_PRESENT


Custom version of Mbed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PlatformIO only has certain versions of mbed-os in the official package package
registry, as queryable through `the API
<https://api.registry.platformio.org/v3/packages/platformio/tool/framework-mbed>`_.

If you want to use another release of the Mbed framework, you can use the
`plateform_packages` config option as described below.

.. warning::

   Using a custom version of mbed-os is not officially supported by platformio. There is
   no guarantee a given version of mbed-os will work with platformio. This is
   recommended for Advanced Users only and may require knowledge of the Python ecosystem
   to install missing dependencies etc.


The `platformio.ini` file should have a `plateform_packages` config entry which
references a directory containing `mbed-os <https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os>`_
itself, plus the platformio `mbed builder code
<https://github.com/platformio/builder-framework-mbed>`_ and a `package.json` file like:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name": "framework-mbed",
     "version": "6.61500.211003",
     "description": "Arm Mbed OS is a platform operating system designed for the internet of things",
     "keywords": [
       "framework",
       "os",
       "arm",
       "hal"
     ],
     "homepage": "http://mbed.org",
     "repository": {
       "type": "git",
       "url": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os"
     }
   }

For example, to use the version 6.15 of mbed-os, you may:

.. code-block:: bash

   ~$ git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os framework-mbed
   ~$ cd framework-mbed
   ~/framework-mbed$ git checkout mbed-os-6.15.0
   ~/framework-mbed$ git clone https://github.com/platformio/builder-framework-mbed# platformio
   ~/framework-mbed$ cat >package.json <<EOF
   {
     "name": "framework-mbed",
     "version": "6.61500.211003",
     "description": "Arm Mbed OS is a platform operating system designed for the internet of things",
     "keywords": [
       "framework",
       "os",
       "arm",
       "hal"
     ],
     "homepage": "http://mbed.org",
     "repository": {
       "type": "git",
       "url": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os"
     }
   }
   EOF

Then add the `platform_packages
<https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env_platform.html#platform-packages>`_
config optin in the `platformio.ini` file like:

.. code-block:: ini

   [env:mproject]
   platform = ststm32
   framework = mbed
   platform_packages =
     framework-mbed @ file://framework-mbed
   board = nucleo_f303ze

to build the project for a NUCLEO-F303ZE board using mbed-os 6.15.0 (and make the
USBDevice work).


Build profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, PlatformIO builds your project using ``develop profile`` which provides
optimized firmware size with full error information and allows MCU to go to sleep mode.
In the case when default build profile is not suitable for your project there two other
profiles ``release`` and ``debug`` that can be enabled using special macro definitions.
You can change build profile :ref:`projectconf_build_flags` of :ref:`projectconf`:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Name
      - Description

    * - ``MBED_BUILD_PROFILE_RELEASE``
      - Release profile (smallest firmware, minimal error info)

    * - ``MBED_BUILD_PROFILE_DEBUG``
      - Debug profile (largest firmware, disabled sleep mode)

More information about differences between build profiles can be found on the
official page `ARM Mbed OS Build Profiles <https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.11/tools/build-profiles.html>`_.

Ignoring particular components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you don't need all parts of the framework or you want to reduce the compilation
time, you can explicitly exclude folders with redundant sources. For example, to remove
``cellular``, ``mbedtls`` and ``nanostack`` features from the build process, navigate
to :ref:`projectconf_pio_packages_dir` and create a new file ``framework-mbed/features/.mbedignore``
with the following contents:

.. code-block:: ini

    cellular/*
    mbedtls/*
    nanostack/*

If you want to exclude the entire folder, simply create ``.mbedignore`` file and add
only one symbol ``*`` to this file.

Custom Targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case when your board is not officially supported by :ref:`framework_mbed` you can
manually add custom board definitions to your project. First of all, you need to create
a special file ``custom_targets.json`` in the root folder of your project where you
describe your board, for example here is the configuration for ``NUCLEO-F401RE`` board:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "NUCLEO_F401RE": {
        "inherits": [
            "MCU_STM32"
        ],
        "supported_form_factors": [
            "ARDUINO",
            "MORPHO"
        ],
        "core": "Cortex-M4F",
        "extra_labels_add": [
            "STM32F4",
            "STM32F401xE"
        ],
        "macros_add": [
            "STM32F401xE"
        ],
        "config": {
            "clock_source": {
                "help": "Mask value : USE_PLL_HSE_EXTC | USE_PLL_HSE_XTAL (need HW patch) | USE_PLL_HSI",
                "value": "USE_PLL_HSE_EXTC|USE_PLL_HSI",
                "macro_name": "CLOCK_SOURCE"
            }
        },
        "detect_code": [
            "0720"
        ],
        "device_has_add": [
            "SERIAL_ASYNCH",
            "FLASH",
            "MPU"
        ],
        "device_name": "STM32F401RE"
      }
    }

Secondly, you need to add code specific to your target to the ``src`` folder of your project.
Usually, it's a good idea to isolate this code in a separate folder and add the path to this folder
to :ref:`projectconf_build_flags` of :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:my_custom_board]
  platform = nxplpc
  framework = mbed
  board = my_custom_board
  build_flags = -I$PROJECT_SRC_DIR/MY_CUSTOM_BOARD_TARGET

Next, you need to inform PlatformIO that there is a new custom board. To do this, you can create
``boards`` directory in the root folder of your project and add a board manifest file with your
board name, e.g. ``my_custom_board.json`` as described here :ref:`board_creating`

After these steps, your project structure should look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    project_dir
    â”œâ”€â”€ include
    â”œâ”€â”€ boards
    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ my_custom_board.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp
    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ MY_CUSTOM_BOARD_TARGET
    â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ pinNames.h
    â”‚         â””â”€â”€ pinNames.c
    â”œâ”€â”€ custom_targets.json
    â””â”€â”€ platformio.ini

More information about adding custom targets can be found on the official page
 `Adding and configuring targets <https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.2/porting/porting-custom-boards.html>`_.
