Emacs
=====

GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor - and more. At its core is
an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the
`Lisp programming language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language>`_
with extensions to support text editing.

Refer to the `Emacs Documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Manuals>`_
page for more detailed information.

Integration
-----------

Integration process consists of these steps:

1. Open system Terminal and install :ref:`piocore`
2. Create new folder for your project and change directory (``cd``) to it
3. Generate a project using PIO Core Project Generator (:option:`platformio init --ide`)
4. Import project in IDE.

------------

PlatformIO-Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An Emacs minor mode has been written to facilitate building and uploading from within Emacs.
It can be installed from the MELPA repository using ``M-x package-install``.
See the MELPA `Getting Started <https://melpa.org/#/getting-started>`_ page for more information.

Setup instructions and an example config can be found at the `Github page <https://github.com/ZachMassia/platformio-mode>`_.

Code completion can optionally be provided by installing `irony-mode <https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode>`_


Project Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose board ``ID`` using :ref:`cmd_boards` or `Embedded Boards Explorer <https://platformio.org/boards>`_
command and generate project via :option:`platformio init --ide` command:

.. code-block:: shell

    platformio init --ide emacs --board <ID>


There are 6 predefined targets for building.

* ``platformio_build``  - Build project without auto-uploading.        (``C-c i b``)
* ``platformio_clean``  - Clean compiled objects.                      (``C-c i c``)
* ``platformio_upload`` - Build and upload (if no errors).             (``C-c i u``)
* ``platformio_programmer_upload`` - Build and upload using external programmer (if no errors, see :ref:`atmelavr_upload_via_programmer`). (``C-c i p``)
* ``platformio_spiffs_upload``  - Upload files to file system SPIFFS (see :ref:`platform_espressif_uploadfs`). (``C-c i s``)
* ``platformio_update`` - Update installed platforms and libraries.    (``C-c i d``)

.. warning::
    The libraries which are added, installed or used in the project
    after generating process won't be reflected in IDE. To fix it you
    need to reinitialize project using :ref:`cmd_init` (repeat it).
