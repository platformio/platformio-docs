.. _piocore:

PlatformIO Core
===============

|PIOCORE| (CLI tool) is a heart of whole PlatformIO ecosystem and consists of

* Multi-platform Build System
* Development platform and package managers
* :ref:`librarymanager`
* :ref:`ldf`
* :ref:`Serial Port Monitor <cmd_device_monitor>`
* Integration components (:ref:`ide` and :ref:`ci`).

|PIOCORE| is written in `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD and *ARM*-based credit-card sized
computers (`Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org>`_,
`BeagleBone <http://beagleboard.org>`_,
`CubieBoard <http://cubieboard.org>`_,
`Samsung ARTIK <https://www.artik.io>`_, etc.).


|PIOCORE| provides a rich and documented Command Line Interface (CLI).
The other PlatformIO-based software and IDEs are based on **PlatformIO Core CLI**,
such as :ref:`pioide`. In other words, they wrap |PIOCORE| with own GUI.

.. note::

    Please note that you do not need to install |PIOCORE| if you are going
    to use :ref:`pioide`. |PIOCORE| is built into
    PlatformIO IDE and you will be able to use it within PlatformIO IDE Terminal.

    If you need |PIOCORE| outside PlatformIO IDE, please :ref:`faq_install_shell_commands`.
