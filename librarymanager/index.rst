Library Manager
===============

*PlatformIO Library Manager* is a tool for managing libraries of
`PlatformIO Registry <http://platformio.org/lib>`__ and VCS repositories (Git,
Hg, SVN). It makes it exceedingly simple to find, install and keep libraries
up-to-date. PlatformIO Library Manager supports
`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ and its rules.

-------

:ref:`ide_atom` has built-in Library Manager with a friendly GUI. It allows:

* Search for new libraries in PlatformIO Registry
* "1-click" library installation, per-project libraries, extra storages
* List installed libraries in multiple storages
* List built-in libraries (by frameworks)
* Updates for installed libraries
* Multiple examples, trending libraries, and more.
