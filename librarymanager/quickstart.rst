Quick Start
===========

*PlatformIO Library Manager* is a tool for managing libraries of
`PlatformIO Registry <https://platformio.org/lib>`__ and VCS repositories (Git,
Hg, SVN). It makes it exceedingly simple to find, install and keep libraries
up-to-date. PlatformIO Library Manager supports
`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ and its rules.

There are 3 options how to find/manage libraries:

* :ref:`piohome`
* `Web Library Search <https://platformio.org/lib>`__
* PIO Core :ref:`Command Line Interface <cmd_lib_search>`

You can manage different library storages using
:option:`platformio lib --global` or  :option:`platformio lib --storage-dir`
options. If you change current working directory in terminal to project folder,
then :ref:`platformio lib <cmd_lib>` command will manage automatically dependency
storage in :ref:`projectconf_pio_libdeps_dir`.

Project dependencies
--------------------

*PlatformIO Library Manager* allows one to specify project dependencies
(:ref:`projectconf_lib_deps`) that will be installed automatically per project
before environment processing. You do not need to install libraries manually.
The only one simple step is to define dependencies in :ref:`projectconf`.
You can use library ID, Name or even repository URL. For example,

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:myenv]
  platform = ...
  framework = ...
  board = ...
  lib_deps =
    13
    PubSubClient
    ArduinoJson@~5.6,!=5.4
    https://github.com/gioblu/PJON.git#v2.0
    https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP.git
    https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library/archive/master.zip

Please follow to :ref:`cmd_lib_install` for detailed documentation about
possible values.

.. warning::

  If some libraries are not visible in :ref:`pioide` and Code Completion or
  Code Linting does not work properly, please perform

  * **Atom**: "Menu: PlatformIO > Rebuild C/C++ Project Index (Autocomplete,
    Linter)"
  * **VSCode**: "Menu: View > Command Palette... > PlatformIO: Rebuild C/C++
    Project Index"

PlatformIO IDE
--------------

:ref:`pioide` has built-in :ref:`piohome` with a modern GUI which allows:

* Search for new libraries in PlatformIO Registry
* "1-click" library installation, per-project libraries, extra storages
* List installed libraries in multiple storages
* List built-in libraries (by frameworks)
* Updates for installed libraries
* Multiple examples, trending libraries, and more.
