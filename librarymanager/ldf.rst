Library Dependency Finder (LDF)
===============================

Library Dependency Finder is a core part of PlatformIO Build System that
operates with the C/C++ source files and looks for ``#include ...``
directives to know what header directories to include for the compiler.

In spite of the fact that Library Dependency Finder is written in pure Python,
it evaluates :ref:`ldf_c_cond_syntax` (``#ifdef``, ``if``, ``defined``,
``else``, and ``elif``) without calling ``gcc -E``. This approach allows
to significantly reduce the total compilation time. See :ref:`ldf_mode` for more
details.

.. contents::

Configuration
-------------

Library Dependency Finder can be configured from :ref:`projectconf`:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  ../projectconf/section_env_library

.. _ldf_storage:

Storage
-------

There are different storages where Library Dependency Finder looks for
libraries. These storages (folders) have priority and LDF operates in the next
order:

1. :ref:`projectconf_lib_extra_dirs` - extra storages per build environment
2. :ref:`projectconf_pio_lib_dir` - own/private library storage per project
3. :ref:`projectconf_pio_libdeps_dir` - project dependency storage used by
   :ref:`librarymanager`
4. ":ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`/lib" - global storage per all projects.
5. Library storages built into frameworks, SDKs.

.. _ldf_mode:

Dependency Finder Mode
----------------------

Library Dependency Finder starts work from analyzing source files of the
project (:ref:`projectconf_pio_src_dir`) and can work in the next modes:

:``off``:
    "Manual mode", does not process source files of a project and dependencies.
    Builds only the libraries that are specified in manifests
    (:ref:`library_config`, ``module.json``) or using :ref:`projectconf_lib_deps`
    option.

:``chain``:
    [**DEFAULT**] Parses ALL C/C++ source files of the project and follows
    only by nested includes (``#include ...``, chain...) from the libraries.
    It also parses C, CC, CPP files from libraries which have the same name as
    included header file. **Does not evaluate** :ref:`ldf_c_cond_syntax`.

:``deep``:
    Parses ALL C/C++ source files of the project and parses ALL C/C++ source
    files of the each found dependency (recursively).
    **Does not evaluate** :ref:`ldf_c_cond_syntax`.

:``chain+``:
    The same behavior as for the ``chain`` but **evaluates** :ref:`ldf_c_cond_syntax`.

:``deep+``:
    The same behavior as for the ``deep`` but **evaluates** :ref:`ldf_c_cond_syntax`.

The mode can be changed using :ref:`projectconf_lib_ldf_mode` option in
:ref:`projectconf`. Default value is set to ``chain``.

.. note::
  Usually, when the LDF appears to fail to identify a dependency of a library,
  it is because the dependency is only referenced from a library source file,
  and not a library header file (see example below). In this case, it is
  necessary to either explicitly reference the dependency from the project
  source or :ref:`projectconf` (:ref:`projectconf_lib_deps` option), or change
  the LDF mode to "deep" (not generally recommended).

A difference between ``chain/chain+`` and ``deep/deep+`` modes. For example,
there are 2 libraries:

* Library ``Foo`` with files:

  - ``Foo/foo.h``
  - ``Foo/foo.cpp``
  - ``Foo/extra.cpp``

* Library ``Bar`` with files:

  - ``Bar/bar.h``
  - ``Bar/bar.cpp``

:Case 1:

    * ``lib_ldf_mode = chain``
    * ``Foo/foo.h`` depends on the ``Bar`` library (contains ``#include <bar.h>``)
    * ``#include <foo.h>`` is located in one of the project source files

    Here the nested includes (``project file > foo.h > bar.h``) and LDF
    will find both libraries "Foo`` and ``Bar``.

:Case 2:

    * ``lib_ldf_mode = chain``
    * ``Foo/extra.cpp`` depends on the ``Bar`` library (contains ``#include <bar.h>``)
    * ``#include <foo.h>`` is located in one of the project source files

    In this case, LDF will not find the ``Bar`` library because it doesn't know
    about the CPP file (``Foo/extra.cpp``).

:Case 3:

    * ``lib_ldf_mode = deep``
    * ``Foo/extra.cpp`` depends on ``Bar`` library (contains ``#include <bar.h>``)
    * ``#include <foo.h>`` is located in one of the project source files

    Firstly, LDF finds the ``Foo`` library, then it parses all sources
    from the ``Foo`` library and finds ``Foo/extra.cpp`` that depends
    on ``#include <bar.h>``.  Secondly, it will parse all sources from
    the ``Bar`` library. This operation continues until all
    dependencies will not be parsed.

.. _ldf_compat_mode:

Compatibility Mode
------------------

Compatibility mode allows one to control strictness of Library Dependency Finder.
If library contains one of manifest file (:ref:`library_config`,
``library.properties``, ``module.json``), then LDF check compatibility of this
library with real build environment. Available compatibility modes:

:``off``:
    Does not check for compatibility (is not recommended)

:``soft``:
    [**DEFAULT**] Checks for the compatibility with :ref:`projectconf_env_framework` from
    build environment

:``strict``:
    Checks for the compatibility with :ref:`projectconf_env_framework`
    and :ref:`projectconf_env_platform` from build environment.

This mode can be changed using :ref:`projectconf_lib_compat_mode` option in
:ref:`projectconf`. Default value is set to ``soft``.

.. _ldf_c_cond_syntax:

C/C++ Preprocessor conditional syntax
-------------------------------------

In spite of the fact that Library Dependency Finder is written in pure Python,
it evaluates `C/C++ Preprocessor conditional syntax <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Conditional-Syntax.html#Conditional-Syntax>`_
(``#ifdef``, ``if``, ``defined``, ``else``, and ``elif``) without calling
``gcc -E``. For example,

``platformio.ini``

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    lib_ldf_mode = chain+
    build_flags = -D MY_PROJECT_VERSION=13

``mylib.h``

.. code-block:: c

    #ifdef PROJECT_VERSION
    // include common file for the project
    #include "my_common.h"
    #endif

    #if PROJECT_VERSION < 10
    // this include will be ignored because does not satisfy condition above
    #include "my_old.h"
    #endif
