.. _migration:

Migrating from 2.x to 3.0
=========================

Guidance on how to upgrade from PlatformIO v2.x to v3.x with emphasis on major
changes, what is new, and what is been removed.

PlatformIO 3 is not backwards compatible with v2.x. Use this section as a
general guide to upgrading from v2.x to v3.0. For a broader overview, see
`what is new <https://community.platformio.org/c/announcements>`_ in the v3.0
release announcement.

Major PlatformIO CLI changes
----------------------------

.. note::
	PlatformIO 3.x is 100% non-blocking! You do not need to use ``--force``
	option or setup special ``PLATOFMRIO_SETTING_ENABLE_PROMPTS`` environment.
	Use PlatformIO 3.0 with sub-processing without any risk!

This table shows the CLI changes between v2.x and v3.0.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - PlatformIO 2.x
      - PlatformIO 3.x
    * - platformio platforms
      - :ref:`platformio platform <userguide_platform>`
    * - platformio serialports
      - :ref:`cmd_device`
    * - platformio settings set enable_prompts false
      - Removed! Now, all PlatformIO 3.0 CLI is 100% non-blocking!


PlatformIO 2.x commands will be converted to PlatformIO 3.x automatically.
Nevertheless, we recommend to use PlatformIO 3.x commands for the new projects.

What is new
-----------

Development Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have introduced :ref:`platform_creating_manifest_file` and ported
PlatformIO 2.x development platforms according PlatformIO 3.0 decentralized
architecture. Now, platform related things (build scrips, LD scripts, board
configs, package requirements) are located in own repository. Here is the full
list with `PlatformIO 3.0 open source development platforms <https://github.com/platformio?utf8=âœ“&query=platform->`__. You can fork it, modify or create custom.
See :ref:`platform_creating` guide for details.

* :ref:`platform_creating_manifest_file`
* ``espressif`` development platform has been renamed to :ref:`platform_espressif8266`
* PlatformIO 3.0 :ref:`userguide_platform`
* Custom package repositories
* External embedded board configuration files, isolated build scripts
* Embedded Board compatibility with more than one development platform

Library Manager and Intelligent Build System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Powerful and super-fast :ref:`ldf` that interprets C/C++ Preprocessor
  conditional macros with deep search behavior
* Project dependencies per build environment using `projectconf_lib_deps` option
* Depend on a library using VCS URL (GitHub, Git, ARM mbed code registry, Hg, SVN)
* Install library by name
* Strict search for library dependencies
* Multiple library storages: Project's Local, PlatformIO's Global or Custom
* Allowed :ref:`library_config` to specify sources other than PlatformIO's Repository
* Check library compatibility with project environment before building
* Control Library Dependency Finder for compatibility using :ref:`projectconf_lib_compat_mode` option
* Custom library storages/directories with :ref:`projectconf_lib_extra_dirs` option
* Handle extra build flags, source filters and build script from :ref:`library_config`
* Allowed to disable library archiving (``*.ar``)
* Show detailed build information about dependent libraries (Library Dependency Graph)
* Support for the 3rd party manifests (Arduino IDE "library.properties" and
  ARM mbed "module.json")
* Build System: Attach custom Before/Pre and After/Post actions for targets using :ref:`projectconf_extra_scripts`
