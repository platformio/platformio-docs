Convert Arduino file to C++ manually
------------------------------------

Some :ref:`ide`s don't support Arduino files (``*.ino`` and ``.pde``) because
they are not valid C/C++ based source files:

1. Missing includes such as ``#include <Arduino.h>``
2. Function declarations are omitted.

In this case, code completion and code linting do not work properly or
are disabled. To avoid this issue you can manually convert your INO files to CPP.

For example, we have the next ``Demo.ino`` file:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void setup () {
        someFunction(13);
    }

    void loop() {
        delay(1000);
    }

    void someFunction(int num) {
    }

Let's convert it to  ``Demo.cpp``:

1. Add ``#include <Arduino.h>`` at the top of the source file
2. Declare each custom function (excluding built-in, such as ``setup`` and ``loop``)
   before it will be called.

The final ``Demo.cpp``:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <Arduino.h>

    void someFunction(int num);

    void setup () {
        someFunction(13);
    }

    void loop() {
        delay(1000);
    }

    void someFunction(int num) {
    }

Finish.
