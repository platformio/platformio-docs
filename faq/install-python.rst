Install Python Interpreter
--------------------------

:ref:`piocore` is written in `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ that
is installed by default on all the popular OSs except Windows.

Please navigate to official website and `Download the latest Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
and install it. Please **READ NOTES BELOW**.

:macOS:
  Please read the "Important Information" displayed during installation for information
  about SSL/TLS certificate validation and the running the **"Install Certificates.command"**.

  If you do not install SSL/TLS certificates, PlatformIO will not be able to download
  dependent packages, libraries, and toolchains.

:Windows:
  Please select ``Add Python to Path`` (see below), otherwise, ``python`` command will
  not be available.

:Linux:
  Most linux distributions will include a Python installation already. You may need to ensure that the Python Virtual Environment is installed. 

  Debian/Ubuntu derivatives have this package in Apt as ``python3-venv``.

  ``sudo apt install python3-venv`` should be all that is required.
