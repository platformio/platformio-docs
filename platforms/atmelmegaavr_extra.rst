Upload using Programmer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the case of external programmers, it's easy to brick a board simply by specifying
incorrect upload flags. It's highly recommended to use the
:ref:`projectconf_upload_command` option that gives the full control over flags used
for uploading. Please read :ref:`atmelavr_upload_via_programmer` for more information.

Upload using pymcuprog serialUPDI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``pymcuprog`` is a Python-based CLI tool for programming AVR devices with UPDI interface
using either a Microchip debugger (Atmel-ICE, Power Debugger, PICkit4, Snap, PKOB nano /
nEDBG / Curiosity Nano debugger) or via a standard serial port. It can be installed
directly in the PlatformIO virtual environment using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pymcuprog


Once ``pymcuprog`` is installed it can be used as the uploader via a custom
:ref:`projectconf_upload_command` option, for example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:ATmega3209_pymcuprog_upload]
    platform = atmelmegaavr
    framework = arduino
    board = ATmega3209
    upload_speed = 115200
    upload_flags =
        --tool
        uart
        --device
        atmega3209
        --uart
        $UPLOAD_PORT
        --clk
        $UPLOAD_SPEED
    upload_command = pymcuprog write --erase $UPLOAD_FLAGS --filename $SOURCE

.. note::

    When using a Microchip debugger it must be specified in the --tool argument, and the --uart argument omitted.

More information and a typical circuit diagram can be found in the official
`pymcuprog repository <https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-tools/pymcuprog#serial-port-updi-pyupdi>`_.

``pymcuprog`` is maintained by Microchip, and published on `GitHub <https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-tools/pymcuprog>`_ and `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/project/pymcuprog/>`_.

Upload using pyupdi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``pyupdi`` is a Python-based tool for programming tinyAVR and megaAVR devices with UPDI
interface via a standard serial port. It can be installed directly in the PlatformIO
virtual environment using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi/archive/master.zip


Once ``pyupdi`` is installed it can be used as the uploader via a custom
:ref:`projectconf_upload_command` option, for example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:ATmega3209_pyupdi_upload]
    platform = atmelmegaavr
    framework = arduino
    board = ATmega3209
    upload_speed = 115200
    upload_flags =
        -d
        mega3209
        -c
        $UPLOAD_PORT
        -b
        $UPLOAD_SPEED
    upload_command = pyupdi $UPLOAD_FLAGS -f $SOURCE

.. warning::

    Device names used in in ``pyupdi`` differ from MCU names used in the ``atmelmegaavr``
    platform. Run ``pyupdi --help`` to see the list of supported devices.

More information and a typical circuit diagram can be found in the official
`pyupdi repository <https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi>`_ repository.

Fuses programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO has a built-in target called ``fuses`` for setting fuse bits. The default fuse
bits are predefined in the board manifest file in the ``fuses`` section. For example,
`fuses section for Arduino Nano Every board <https://github.com/platformio/platform-atmelmegaavr/blob/develop/boards/nano_every.json>`_.
To set fuse bits you need to use target ``fuses`` with :option:`pio run --target` command.

Custom fuses
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Custom fuse values and upload flags (based on upload protocol) should be specified in
:ref:`projectconf`. An example of setting custom fuses for ``ATmega3209`` board:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:custom_fuses]
    platform = atmelmegaavr
    framework = arduino
    board = ATmega3209
    upload_protocol = xplainedmini_updi
    board_fuses.bootend = 0xAA
    board_fuses.syscfg0 = 0xBB
    board_fuses.osccfg = 0xCC

Overriding default fuses command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For more detailed information read :ref:`atmelavr_overriding_fuses_command`.

Bootloader programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO has a built-in target called ``bootloader`` for flashing bootloaders. The
default bootloader image and corresponding fuse bits are predefined in the board manifest
file in the ``bootloader`` section, for example, `Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2 <https://github.com/platformio/platform-atmelmegaavr/blob/develop/boards/uno_wifi_rev2.json>`_.
To upload a bootloader image you need to use target ``bootloader`` with
:option:`pio run --target` command.

Custom bootloader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Custom bootloader and accompanying fuses should be specified in :ref:`projectconf`.
An example of setting custom bootloader for ``ATmega4808`` board:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:ATmega4808]
    platform = atmelmegaavr
    framework = arduino
    board = ATmega4808

    board_bootloader.file = /path/to/custom/bootloader.hex
    board_bootloader.bootend = 0xFF
    board_bootloader.syscfg0 = 0xDE
    board_bootloader.osccfg = 0xFD
    board_bootloader.lock_bits = 0x0F

Overriding default bootloader command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For more detailed information read :ref:`atmelavr_overriding_bootloader_command`.
