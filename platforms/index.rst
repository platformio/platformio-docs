Development Platforms
=====================

The PlatformIO ecosystem has a decentralized architecture, allowing
development for a range of *development platforms*. A development
platform (or just "platform" for short) is usually a particular
microcontroller or processor architecture that PlatformIO projects can
be compiled to run on. (A few platforms, for example Teensy, use
different target architectures for different boards.)

Each of the three supported host systems Mac OS X, Linux and Windows
support compiling for all platforms listed below. Some platforms are
also supported under ARM Linux hosts such as Raspberry Pi. For each
development platform, PlatformIO defines:

- The **PlatformIO Build System** build scripts for the supported frameworks
  and SDKs
- Pre-configured presets for embedded circuit boards
- Pre-compiled toolchains and related tools for the architecture(s)

Each project must specify the platform name using the
:ref:`projectconf_env_platform` option in :ref:`projectconf`. A
specific platform version can optionally be specified as well. As
embedded boards are equipped with a particular microcontroller, each
embedded board specifies what development platform it uses and this
can not be changed.

If a new board uses an architecture not in this list, a custom
development platform can be created; see :ref:`platform_creating`.

The full list of supported development platforms is accessible on the
`PlatformIO Registry <https://registry.platformio.org/search?t=platform>`__.
