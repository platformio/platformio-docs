Custom Embedded Boards
======================

*PlatformIO* has pre-built settings for many popular embedded
boards. The list of these boards is available as a web page at
`PlatformIO Boards Explorer <https://platformio.org/boards>`_ or
through the CLI command :ref:`cmd_boards`.

Custom boards can also be defined from scratch or by overriding settings
of existing boards. All data is declared using the `JSON syntax
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ via `associative array
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array>`_ name/value pairs.

JSON Structure
--------------

The key fields are:

* ``build`` data is handed over to the :ref:`platforms` and :ref:`frameworks` builders
* ``frameworks`` is the list with supported :ref:`frameworks`. Each working environment for each project that uses the board will choose one of the frameworks declared here.
* ``platform`` name of :ref:`platforms`
* ``upload`` upload settings which depend on the ``platform``

For details, see existing boards as examples, available under ``.platformio/platforms/*/boards/``.

Installation
------------

1. Create ``boards`` directory in :ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir` if it
   doesn't exist.
2. Create ``myboard.json`` file in this ``boards`` directory.
3. Search available boards via :ref:`cmd_boards` command. You should see
   ``myboard`` board.

Now, you can use ``myboard`` for the :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in
:ref:`projectconf`.

.. note::
  You can have custom boards per project. In this case, please put your
  board's JSON files to :ref:`projectconf_pio_boards_dir`.

Examples
--------

Please take a look at the source code of
`PlatformIO Development Platforms <https://github.com/platformio?query=platform->`_
and navigate to ``boards`` folder of the repository.
