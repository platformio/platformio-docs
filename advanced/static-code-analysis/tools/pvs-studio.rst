PVS-Studio
==========

**PVS-Studio** is a static code analysis tool for detecting bugs and security weaknesses
in the source code of programs, written in C, C++, C# and Java. It analyzes source code
intended for 32-bit, 64-bit and embedded ARM platforms.
The official page can be found `here  <https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/>`__.

Features
--------

**PVS-Studio** performs a wide range of code checks, and it is also useful in finding
misprints and Copy-Paste errors. These checks are static analysis checks that can be
performed at a source code level. Some of the defects that might be detected include:

- Arithmetic over/underflow
- Array index out of bounds
- Undefined/unspecified behavior
- Incorrect usage of exceptions
- Buffer overrun
- Null pointer/null reference dereference
- Improper understanding of function/class operation logic
- Illegal bitwise/shift operations

The full list of supported checks can be found on
`the official webpage  <https://www.viva64.com/en/w/>`__.

Configuration
-------------

To enable **PVS-Studio** tool simply add it to the :ref:`projectconf_check_tool`
option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    check_tool = pvs-studio

Useful options that can be used used for adjusting check process:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    ../../../projectconf/sections/env/options/check/index

Extra flags
-----------

Useful flags that can help more precisely configure **PVS-Studio** to satisfy
your project requirements:

  .. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Flag
      - Meaning

    * - ``--analysis-mode <arg>``
      - Analysis mode (``0`` - full analysis (default), ``1`` - 64-bit. analysis, ``2`` - reserved, ``4`` - general analysis, ``8`` - optimization, ``16`` - customer's specific requests, ``32`` - MISRA)

    * - ``--analyzer-errors <arg>``
      - Errors activation (Default: all errors is on)

    * - ``--errors-off <arg>``
      - Errors OFF (Default: all errors is on)

    * - ``--exclude-path <arg>``
      - All code that is located under the path will be excluded from analysis

    * - ``--lic-file <arg>``
      - Path to custom license file. Default locations ``~/.config/PVS-Studio/PVS-Studio.lic`` on Unix and ``%APPDATA%\PVS-Studio\PVS-Studio.lic`` on Windows

    * - ``--rules-config <arg>``
      - Specifies the path to rules configuration file.

    * - ``--platform <arg>``
      - Platform name (Win32, x64, etc) (Default: ``ARM``)


An example with a special analysis mode, disabled errors and license file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    check_tool = pvs-studio
    check_flags =
      pvs-studio: --analysis-mode=4 --errors-off=V532,V586 --lic-file=/path/to/file.lic


Obtaining license
-----------------

Since **PVS-Studio** is a paid B2B solution, `a license <https://www.viva64.com/en/order>`__
should be purchased. But PVS-Studio can be used for free of charge, for example for
checking open source projects. More information about the cases when you can get a free
**PVS-Studio** license can be found on `the official webpage <https://www.viva64.com/en/open-source-license/>`__.

.. tip::
    If you're experiencing problems with the license file or see the following error message:
    ``License information is incorrect. Please check your registration data or contact
    Customer Support``, try saving the license file in ``UTF-8 + BOM`` format with the
