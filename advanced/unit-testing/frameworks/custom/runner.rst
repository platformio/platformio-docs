.. _unit_testing_frameworks_custom_runner:

Custom Test Runner
------------------

Setting the :ref:`projectconf_test_framework` option to the ``custom``
will instruct PlatformIO to look for a ``test_custom_runner.py``
file located in the current (running) test folder. If the file is
not found, PlatformIO will check the parent folders
in a tree until reaches the :ref:`projectconf_pio_test_dir`.

If you plan to use a custom test framework for ALL tests, please
put the ``test_custom_runner.py`` file at the root of
:ref:`projectconf_pio_test_dir`. Otherwise, use
:ref:`unit_testing_test_hierarchy` and put it to the test folder
or to the group of tests that depend on it.

The ``test_custom_runner.py`` is a Python-based script. It must
contain the :ref:`unit_testing_frameworks_custom_api_test_runner`
class. See a base example of ``test_custom_runner.py``:

.. code:: python

    from platformio.public import TestRunnerBase

    class CustomTestRunner(TestRunnerBase):
        pass

In case you want to override the functionality of the existing
testing framework, you have to inherit its class. For example,
let's override a "testing" stage for the :ref:`unit_testing_frameworks_unity`:

.. code:: python

    from platformio.public import TestCase, TestCaseSource, TestStatus, UnityTestRunner


    class CustomTestRunner(UnityTestRunner):
        def stage_testing(self):
            # 1. Gather test results from Serial, HTTP, Socket, or other sources
            # 2. Report test results (add cases)

            # Exmaple: Report succeed result with duration (optional)
            self.test_suite.add_case(
                TestCase(name="test_connectivity", status=TestStatus.PASSED, duration=1.34)
            )

            # Example: Report failed result with source file
            self.test_suite.add_case(
                TestCase(
                    name="test_calculator_division",
                    status=TestStatus.FAILED,
                    message="Expected 32 Was 33",
                    stdout="test/test_desktop/test_calculator.cpp:43:test_calculator_division:FAIL: Expected 32 Was 33",
                    duration=0.44,
                    source=TestCaseSource(
                        filename="test/test_desktop/test_calculator.cpp", line=43
                    ),
                )
            )
