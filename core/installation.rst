On *Windows OS* it may look like:

.. code-block:: bash

    # change directory to folder where is located downloaded "get-platformio.py"
    cd C:\path\to\dir\where\is\located\script\get-platformio.py

    # run it
    python.exe get-platformio.py

.. note::
    If you need to have access to ``platformio`` or ``platformio.exe`` commands from
    other applications or terminal in your OS, please :ref:`piocore_install_shell_commands`.

Python Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    We recommend using this method **ONLY FOR** :ref:`ci` use cases or where your have
    full permissions to install PlatformIO Core into the global scope of your OS.

    For personal using, and avoiding maintenance and upgrade issues, we
    **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** using :ref:`installation_installer_script` which installs
    |PIOCore| into an isolated virtual environment and does not affect your OS.

The latest stable version of |PIOCore| may be installed or upgraded via
Python Package Manager (`pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_) as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U platformio

macOS Homebrew
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest stable version of PlatformIO may be installed or upgraded via
macOS Homebrew Packages Manager (`brew <http://brew.sh/>`_) as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install platformio

Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PlatformIO Core may be installed into isolated Python environment. This
method is very good if you don't want to install PlatformIO Core Python's
dependencies (packages) into your global system scope. :ref:`pioide` uses this
method to install PlatformIO Core.

Default and recommended environment folder is ":ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`/penv".
You can print **environment folder path** using the next command in your
system terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import os; print(os.path.join(os.getenv('PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR', os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.platformio')), 'penv'))"

    ######################## Examples
    # Windows
    # C:\Users\UserName\.platformio\penv

    # Linux
    # ~/.platformio/penv
    # /home/username/.platformio/penv

    # macOS
    # ~/.platformio/penv
    # /Users/username/.platformio/penv

Prerequisites
'''''''''''''

1.  Please remove existing PlatformIO Core **environment folder** if exists.
    See above command how to get path to environment folder.

2.  Please check that you have a valid Python interpreter running a next
    command in system terminal. Python 2.7.9+ or Python 3.5+ is recommended.

    .. code-block:: bash

        python --version

        # or, for Unix (Linux, Mac), you can use `python2` or `python3` aliases
        python2 --version
        python3 --version

    .. warning::
        **Windows Users**: If you already tried to install :ref:`pioide` and did
        not get success, please open system's Control Panel > Installed Programs,
        and check if PlatformIO IDE tried to install an own isolated Python 2.7
        version. Please uninstall it. Also is good to uninstall all Python
        interpreters from a system and install manually the latest Python
        using :ref:`faq_install_python` guide.

3.  Make sure ``virtualenv --help`` command exists in a system, otherwise,
    please install it manually using ``pip install virtualenv`` or
    ``pip2 install virtualenv`` command.

    If ``pip`` (Python Package Manager) does not exists, you have to install it
    manually. See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Creating
''''''''

1.  Create a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the
    packages that PIO Core would need using ``virtualenv`` command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        virtualenv /path/to/.platformio/penv

        # If you want to use a custom Python interpreter
        virtualenv --python=/path/to/custom/python /path/to/.platformio/penv

        # EXAMPLES
        # Windows
        virtualenv C:\Users\UserName\.platformio\penv
        virtualenv --python=C:\Python27\python.exe  C:\Users\UserName\.platformio\penv

        # Unix (Linux, Mac)
        virtualenv ~/.platformio/penv
        virtualenv -p python3 ~/.platformio/penv

2.  Activate virtual environment

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Windows
        C:\Users\UserName\.platformio\penv\Scripts\activate

        # Unix (Linux, Mac)
        source /path/to/.platformio/penv/bin/activate
        # or
        . /path/to/.platformio/penv/bin/activate

3.  Install PIO Core into virtual environment

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install -U platformio

If you plan to use PIO Core commands outside virtual environment, please
:ref:`piocore_install_shell_commands`.

.. _installation_develop:

Development Version
-------------------

.. warning::
    If you use :ref:`pioide`, please enable development version:

    * :ref:`ide_atom`: "Menu PlatformIO: Settings > PlatformIO IDE > Use development
      version of PlatformIO Core"
    * :ref:`ide_vscode`: Set ``platformio-ide.useDevelopmentPIOCore`` to ``true`` in
      :ref:`ide_vscode_settings`.

Install the latest PlatformIO from the ``develop`` branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    # uninstall existing version
    pip uninstall platformio

    # install the latest development version of PlatformIO
    pip install -U https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/archive/develop.zip

If you want to be up-to-date with the latest ``develop`` version of PlatformIO,
then you need to re-install PlatformIO each time you see a new commits in
`PlatformIO GitHub repository (branch: develop) <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/commits/develop>`_ like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/archive/develop.zip

Or:

.. code-block:: bash

    pio upgrade --dev

To revert to the latest stable version:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall platformio
    pip install -U platformio

.. _piocore_install_shell_commands:

Install Shell Commands
----------------------

:ref:`piocore` consists of 2 standalone tools in a system:

* ``platformio`` or ``pio`` (short alias) - :ref:`piocore_userguide`
* ``piodebuggdb`` - alias of :ref:`cmd_debug`

If you have :ref:`pioide` already installed, you do not need to install
:ref:`piocore` separately. Just link these tools with your shell:

.. contents::
    :local:

Unix and Unix-like
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Unix and Unix-like systems, there are multiple ways to achieve this.

Method 1
''''''''

You can export PlatformIO executables' directory to the PATH environmental
variable. This method will allow you to execute ``platformio`` commands from
any terminal emulator as long as you're logged in as the user PlatformIO is
installed and configured for.

If you use Bash as your default shell, you can do it by editing either
``~/.profile`` or ``~/.bash_profile`` and adding the following line:

.. code-block:: shell

 Â   export PATH=$PATH:~/.platformio/penv/bin

If you use Zsh, you can either edit ``~/.zprofile`` and add the code above, or
for supporting both, Bash and Zsh, you can first edit ``~/.profile`` and add
the code above, then edit ``~/.zprofile`` and add the following line:

.. code-block:: shell

 Â   emulate sh -c '. ~/.profile'

After everything's done, just restart your session (log out and log back in) and you're good to go.

If you don't know the difference between the two, check out `this page <https://serverfault.com/questions/261802/what-are-the-functional-differences-between-profile-bash-profile-and-bashrc>`_.

Method 2
''''''''

You can create system-wide symlinks. This method is not recommended if you have
multiple users on your computer because the symlinks will be broken for other users
and they will get errors while executing PlatformIO commands. If that's not a problem,
open your system terminal app and paste these commands
(**MAY require** administrator access ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: shell

    ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio /usr/local/bin/platformio
    ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio /usr/local/bin/pio
    ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/piodebuggdb /usr/local/bin/piodebuggdb

After that, you should be able to run PlatformIO from terminal. No restart is required.

Windows
~~~~~~~

Please read one of these instructions `How do I set or change the PATH system variable? <https://www.google.com.ua/search?q=how+do+i+set+or+change+the+path+system+variable>`_

You need to edit system environment variable called ``Path`` and append
``C:\Users\UserName\.platformio\penv\Scripts;`` path in the beginning of a
list (please replace ``UserName`` with your account name).


.. _piocore_uninstall:

Uninstall PIO Core and dependent packages
-----------------------------------------

* Uninstall PIO Core tool

    .. code-block:: bash

        # uninstall standalone PIO Core installed via `pip`
        pip uninstall platformio

        # uninstall Homebrew's PIO Core (only macOS users if you installed it via Homebrew before)
        brew uninstall platformio

* Dependent packages, global libraries are installed to :ref:`projectconf_pio_core_dir`
  folder (in user's HOME directory). Just remove it.

Integration with custom applications (extensions, plugins)
----------------------------------------------------------

We recommend using PlatformIO Core **Installer Script** when you integrate PlatformIO Core
into an application, such as extension or plugin for IDE. Examples that use this installer are:

- `platformio-node-helpers <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-node-helpers>`_,
  is used by `PlatformIO IDE for VSCode <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide>`_
  and `PlatformIO IDE for Atom <https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide>`_

Prerequisite
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python Interpreter
''''''''''''''''''

PlatformIO Core Installer Script is written in Python and is compatible with Python 2.7+
and Python 3.5+. **We highly recommend using Python 3**.

Python is installed by default on the most popular Unix OS (macOS, Linux, FreeBSD).
If there is no Python on a user machine (you can check running ``python --version``),
we have 2 options:

1. Ask the user to install Python 3 using our guide :ref:`faq_install_python`
2. You can automatically `Download Portable Python 3 <https://bintray.com/beta/#/platformio/dl-misc/python-portable?tab=files>`_
   and unpack it in a cache folder of your application. Later, you can use
   ``unpacked_protable_python_dir/python.exe``  for the installer script.

Installer Script
''''''''''''''''

There are 2 options on how to work with PlatformIO Core Installer Script:

1. Bundle `get-platformio.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py>`_ file into your application
2. Download `get-platformio.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py>`_ file on demand.

In both cases, you will need to have ``get-platformio.py`` script on the end-user machine.
You can copy or download it to a cache/temporary folder.

A list of arguments and options for the installer script is available via

.. code-block:: bash

    python get-platformio.py --help

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

We will describe a simple workflow no how to automatically install :ref:`piocore` for
end-user of your application/extension. We assume that ``get-platformio.py`` script
is already copied/downloaded and exists on the end-user machine. See above how to get it.

Step 1. Where is PlatformIO Core installed?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

You should check the PlatformIO Core installation state **each time** when the user
starts your application. You need to call the Installer Script with ``check core`` arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    python get-platformio.py check core

This command returns ``0`` "exit code" when PlatformIO Core is already installed
and is ready for use, otherwise, the non-zero code of subprocess will be returned and
you need to install PlatformIO Core (see **Step #2** below).

If you need to have full information about PlatformIO Core installation state,
please run with ``--dump-state`` option and specify a folder or a full path where
to save data in JSON format:

.. code-block:: bash

    get-platformio.py check core --dump-state tmpdir/pioinstaller-state.json

Now, read JSON file and use ``platformio_exe`` binary to call PlatforIO Core using CLI
(see :ref:`piocore_userguide`). You can also export ``penv_bin_dir`` into system
environment ``PATH`` variable and ``platformio`` command will be available without
a full path.

Example of ``pioinstaller-state.json`` run on macOS:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "cache_dir": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/.cache",
      "core_dir": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio",
      "core_version": "4.3.1",
      "installer_version": "0.2.0",
      "is_develop_core": false,
      "penv_bin_dir": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/penv/bin",
      "penv_dir": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/penv",
      "platformio_exe": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio",
      "python_exe": "/Users/Freedom/.platformio/penv/bin/python",
      "system": "darwin_x86_64"
    }

Step 2. Install PlatformIO Core
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To install PlatformIO Core into the virtual environment in an automatic mode, please call
installer script without any arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    python get-platformio.py

Available options:

- ``--verbose``, verbose output
- ``--dev``, install the latest development version of PlatformIO Core
- ``--ignore-python``, a path to Python to be ignored (multiple options and unix wildcards are allowed)

More options are available at ``python get-platformio.py --help``.

Installer Script will return exit code ``0`` on success, otherwise non-zero code and
error explanation.

Next time just use again ``python get-platformio.py check core`` as described in Step #1 (see above).

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. note::
    **Linux OS**: Don't forget to install "udev" rules file
    `99-platformio-udev.rules <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/blob/develop/scripts/99-platformio-udev.rules>`_ (an instruction is located in the file).

    **Windows OS**: Please check that you have correctly installed USB driver
    from board manufacturer

For further details, frequently questions, known issues, please
refer to :ref:`faq`.
