Upload options
--------------

.. contents::
    :local:

.. _projectconf_upload_port:

``upload_port``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``String (Pattern)`` | Multiple: ``No``

This option is used by "uploader" tool when sending firmware to board via
``upload_port``. For example,

* ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` - Serial port (Unix-based OS)
* ``COM3`` - Serial port (Windows OS)
* ``192.168.0.13`` - IP address when using OTA
* ``/media/disk`` - physical path to media disk/flash drive
  (:ref:`framework_mbed` enabled boards)
* ``D:`` - physical path to media disk/flash drive (Windows OS).

If ``upload_port`` isn't specified, then *PlatformIO* will try to detect it
automatically.

To print all available serial ports please use :ref:`cmd_device_list` command.

This option can also be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_UPLOAD_PORT`.

Please note that you can use Unix shell-style wildcards:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Pattern
      - Meaning

    * - ``*``
      - matches everything

    * - ``?``
      - matches any single character

    * - ``[seq]``
      - matches any character in seq

    * - ``[!seq]``
      - matches any character not in seq

**Example**

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:uno]
    platform = atmelavr
    framework = arduino
    ; any port that starts with /dev/ttyUSB
    upload_port = /dev/ttyUSB*

    ; COM1 or COM3
    upload_port = COM[13]

.. _projectconf_upload_protocol:

``upload_protocol``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``No``

A protocol that "uploader" tool uses to talk to a board. Please check
:ref:`boards` for supported uploading protocols by your board.

.. note::
    ``upload_protocol = custom`` allows one to use a custom ``upload_command`` - see below.
    
    

.. _projectconf_upload_speed:

``upload_speed``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``Integer`` | Multiple: ``No``

A connection speed (`baud rate <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud>`_)
which "uploader" tool uses when sending firmware to board.

.. _projectconf_upload_flags:

``upload_flags``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``Yes``

Extra flags for uploader. Will be added to the end of uploader command. If you
need to override uploader command or base flags please use
:ref:`projectconf_extra_scripts`.

This option can also be set by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_UPLOAD_FLAGS`.

**Example**

Please specify each flag/option in a new line starting with minimum 2 spaces.

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:atmega328pb]
    platform = atmelavr
    board = atmega328pb
    framework = arduino
    upload_flags =
      -P$UPLOAD_PORT
      -b$UPLOAD_SPEED
      -u
      -Ulock:w:0xCF:m
      -Uhfuse:w:0xD7:m
      -Uefuse:w:0xF6:m
      -Ulfuse:w:0xE2:m

.. _projectconf_upload_resetmethod:

``upload_resetmethod``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``No``

Specify reset method for "uploader" tool. This option isn't available for all
development platforms. The only :ref:`platform_espressif8266` supports it.

.. _projectconf_upload_command:

``upload_command``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``String`` | Multiple: ``No``

Override default :ref:`platforms` upload command with a custom command. You can pass a full
upload command with arguments and options or mix with :ref:`projectconf_upload_flags`.

In order to use ``upload_command``, ``upload_protocol = custom`` must be specified.

Default upload commands are declared in ``build/main.py`` script file of
:ref:`platforms`. See a list with open source
:ref:`platforms` => https://github.com/topics/platformio-platform

.. note::
  Please note that you can use build variables in ``upload_command``, such as
  PlatformIO project folders and other runtime configuration. A list with
  build variables are available by running
  ``platformio run --target envdump`` command.

**Examples**

1.  Override default upload command but handle pre-uploading actions (looking
    for serial port, extra image preparation, etc.). Normally, the
    pre-configured upload options will be stored in ``$UPLOADERFLAGS`` build
    variable. A classic default upload command for :ref:`platforms` may look as
    ``some-flash-bin-tool $UPLOADERFLAGS $SOURCE``, where
    ``$SOURCE`` will be replaced by a real program/firmware binary.

    ``$PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR`` build variable points to :ref:`projectconf_pio_packages_dir`.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [env:program_via_AVR_ISP]
        platform = atmelavr
        framework = arduino
        board = uno
        upload_protocol = custom
        upload_flags =
            -C
            $PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR/tool-avrdude/avrdude.conf
            -p
            atmega328p
            -P
            $UPLOAD_PORT
            -b
            115200
            -c
            stk500v1
        upload_command = avrdude $UPLOAD_FLAGS -U flash:w:$SOURCE:i

2.  Override default upload command and skip pre-uploading actions.

    .. code-block:: ini

        [env:program_via_usbasp]
        platform = atmelavr
        framework = arduino
        board = uno
        upload_protocol = custom        
        upload_flags =
            -C
            $PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR/tool-avrdude/avrdude.conf
            -p
            atmega328p
            -Pusb
            -c
            stk500v1
        upload_command = avrdude $UPLOAD_FLAGS -U flash:w:$SOURCE:i


        ; Use ST-util for flashing
        ; https://github.com/texane/stlink

        [env:custom_st_flash]
        platform = ststm32
        framework = stm32cube
        board = bluepill_f103c6
        upload_protocol = custom        
        upload_command = $PROJECT_PACKAGES_DIR/tool-stlink/st-flash write $SOURCE 0x8000000
