.. _projectconf_interpolation:

Interpolation of Values
-----------------------

In addition to its core functionality, PlatformIO introduces support for
interpolation, allowing values to incorporate format strings that
reference other values from different sections.

The interpolation feature adheres to the following syntax:

* ``${<variable>}``, where ``<variable>`` represents the name of a supported
  built-in variable (refer to the table below for details).
* ``${<section>.<option>}``, with ``<section>`` denoting a value from the
  ``[<section>]`` group, and ``<option>`` representing the first item in
  the pair ``<option> = value``.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Syntax
      - Meaning
      - Example

    * - ``${<variable>}``
      - Incorporate built-in variables using their designated names.
        The following variables are supported:

        * ``PROJECT_DIR`` - represents the current project directory
        * ``PROJECT_HASH`` - corresponds to the hash of the project path
        * ``UNIX_TIME`` - indicates the current  `Unix time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`__,
          represented by 10 digits

      - ``/tmp/pio-workspaces/${PROJECT_HASH}`` refers to the new directory ``/tmp/pio-workspaces/project_name-8f66e9463d/``

    * - ``${sysenv.<name>}``
      - Embed operating system environment variable by a name
      - ``${sysenv.HOME}`` refers to the user home directory on Unix machine

    * - ``${platformio.<option>}``
      - Embed value from :ref:`projectconf_section_platformio`
      - ``${platformio.packages_dir}`` refers to the path of :ref:`projectconf_pio_packages_dir`

    * - ``${env.<option>}``
      - Embed default value from :ref:`projectconf_section_env`
      - ``${env.debug_build_flags}`` refers to the default debugging flags

    * - ``${<section>.<option>}``
      - Embed value from another section.
      - ``${extra.lib_deps}`` embeds library dependencies declared in the section named ``extra``

    * - ``${this.<option>}``
      - Embed value from the current section without declaring a section name
      - ``${this.board}`` refers to the "board" value of the current section

    * - ``${this.__env__}``
      - Embed environment name of the current section. The section must start with ``env:`` prefix
      - ``${this.__env__}`` will embed "foo" value being declared in the "env:foo" section

* Interpolation can span multiple levels
* Interpolation can be applied only for the option's value
* Multiple interpolations are allowed
* The :ref:`projectconf_section_platformio` and :ref:`projectconf_section_env`
  sections are reserved and could not be used as a custom section. Some good
  section names might be ``extra`` or ``custom``.

.. note::
    If you need to **share common configuration options** between build
    environments, please take a look at **"Global scope"** in
    :ref:`projectconf_section_env` or :ref:`projectconf_env_extends` option which
    allows extending of other sections.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: ini

    ; COMMON options
    ; Each "[env:***]" extends this "[env]" by default
    [env]
    framework = arduino
    build_flags = -D VERSION=1.2.3

    ; CUSTOM options
    ; You need manually inject these options into a section
    ; using ${extra.<name_of_option>} (see below)
    [extra]
    lib_deps_builtin =
      SPI
      Wire
    lib_deps_external =
      bblanchon/ArduinoJson@>5.6.0

    [env:uno]
    platform = atmelavr
    board = uno
    lib_deps =
      ${extra.lib_deps_builtin}
      ${extra.lib_deps_external}
    platform_packages =
      platformio/tool-simavr
    test_speed = 9600
    test_testing_command =
      ${platformio.packages_dir}/tool-simavr/bin/simavr
      -m
      atmega328p
      -f
      16000000L
      ${platformio.build_dir}/${this.__env__}/firmware.elf

    [env:esp32dev]
    platform = espressif32
    board = esp32dev
    build_flags = ${env.build_flags} -Wall
    lib_deps =
      ${extra.lib_deps_builtin}
      ${extra.lib_deps_external}
      knolleary/PubSubClient @ ~2.6
      paulstoffregen/OneWire @ ^2.3.5

    ; Keep sensitive data in environment variables
    ;
    ; Unix
    ; export WIFI_SSID='\"my\ ssid\ name\"'
    ; export WIFI_PASS='\"my\ password\"'
    ;
    ; Windows
    ; set WIFI_SSID='"my ssid name"'
    ; set WIFI_PASS='"my password"'


.. warning::

    Be careful with special characters in system environment variables on Unix systems,
    especially when they are used as the value for preprocessor directives.
    Symbols like ``$``, ``&``, ``~``, etc must be explicitly escaped, for example:

    .. code-block:: bash

      export WIFI_PASS='\"my\~p\&a\\\$\$\$\$word\"'
