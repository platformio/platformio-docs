.. _projectconf_env_platform:

``platform``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`platforms` name.

PlatformIO allows one to use specific version of platform using
`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ (X.Y.Z=MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) or VCS
(Git, Mercurial and Subversion).

Version specifications can take any of the following forms:

* ``1.2.3``: an exact version number. Use only this exact version
* ``^1.2.3``: any compatible version (exact version for ``1.x.x`` versions)
* ``~1.2.3``: any version with the same major and minor versions, and an
  equal or greater patch version
* ``>1.2.3``: any version greater than ``1.2.3``. ``>=``, ``<``, and ``<=``
  are also possible
* ``>0.1.0,!=0.2.0,<0.3.0``: any version greater than ``0.1.0``, not equal to
  ``0.2.0`` and less than ``0.3.0``

Other forms are the same as for the  :ref:`cmd_platform_install` command.

Examples:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:the_latest_version]
    platform = atmelavr

    [env:exact_version]
    platform = atmelavr@1.2.3

    [env:specific_major_version]
    platform = atmelavr@^1.2.3

    [env:specific_major_and_minor_version]
    platform = atmelavr@~1.2.3

    [env:development_verion_by_git]
    platform = https://github.com/platformio/platform-ststm32.git

    [env:custom_git_branch]
    platform = https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif8266.git#feature/stage

    [env:specific_git_commit]
    platform = https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif8266.git#921855a9c530082efddb5d48b44c3f4be0e2dfa2

.. _projectconf_env_framework:

``framework``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`frameworks` name.

The multiple frameworks are allowed, *split them with comma+space ", "*.

.. _projectconf_env_board:

``board``
^^^^^^^^^

*PlatformIO* has pre-configured settings for the most popular boards:

- build configuration
- upload configuration
- debugging configuration
- connectivity information, etc.

You can find a valid  ``board`` ID in :ref:`boards` catalog,
`Boards Explorer <https://platformio.org/boards>`_ or
:ref:`cmd_boards` command.

.. _projectconf_targets:

``targets``
^^^^^^^^^^^

A list with targets which will be processed by :ref:`cmd_run` command by
default. You can enter more than one target, please split them with
comma+space **", "**.

The list with available targets is located in :option:`platformio run --target`.

**Examples**

1. Build a project using :ref:`Release Configuration <build_configurations>`,
   upload firmware, and start :ref:`Serial Monitor <cmd_device_monitor>`
   automatically:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [env:upload_and_monitor]
       targets = upload, monitor

2. Build a project using :ref:`Debug Configuration <build_configurations>`.


**Tip!** You can use these targets like an option to
:option:`platformio run --target` command. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    # clean project
    platformio run -t clean

    # dump current build environment
    platformio run --target envdump

When no targets are defined, *PlatformIO* will build only sources by default.
