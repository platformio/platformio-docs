.. _projectconf_section_platformio:

Section ``[platformio]``
------------------------

.. contents::
    :local:

A ``platformio`` section is used for overriding default configuration options
for :ref:`piocore`.

.. note::
    Relative path is allowed for directory option:

    * ``~`` will be expanded to user's home directory
    * ``../`` or ``..\`` go up to one folder

Options
~~~~~~~

``description``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Describe a project with a short information. PlatformIO uses it for
:ref:`piohome` in the multiple places.

.. _projectconf_pio_env_default:

``env_default``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`cmd_run` command processes all environments ``[env:***]`` by default
if :option:`platformio run --environment` option is not specified.
:ref:`projectconf_pio_env_default` allows one to define environments which
should be processed by default.

Also, :ref:`piodebug` checks this option when looking for debug environment.

Multiple environments are allowed if they *are separated with ", "
(comma+space)*. For example.

.. code-block:: ini

    [platformio]
    env_default = uno, nodemcu

    [env:uno]
    platform = atmelavr
    framework = arduino
    board = uno

    [env:nodemcu]
    platform = espressif8266
    framework = arduino
    board = nodemcu

    [env:teensy31]
    platform = teensy
    framework = arduino
    board = teensy31

    [env:lpmsp430g2553]
    platform = timsp430
    framework = energia
    board = lpmsp430g2553
    build_flags = -D LED_BUILTIN=RED_LED

.. _projectconf_pio_home_dir:

``home_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Is used to store platform toolchains, frameworks, global libraries for
:ref:`ldf`, service data and etc. The size of this folder will depend on
number of installed development platforms.

A default value is User's home directory:

* Unix ``~/.platformio``
* Windows ``%HOMEPATH%\.platformio``

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_HOME_DIR`.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [platformio]
    home_dir = /path/to/custom/pio/storage

.. _projectconf_pio_build_dir:

``build_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    **PLEASE DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS FOLDER**. PlatformIO will overwrite
    your changes on the next build. **THIS IS A CACHE DIRECTORY**.

*PlatformIO Build System* uses this folder for project
environments to store compiled object files, static libraries, firmwares and
other cached information. It allows PlatformIO to build source code extremely
fast!

*You can delete this folder without any risk!* If you modify :ref:`projectconf`,
then PlatformIO will remove this folder automatically. It will be created on the
next build operation.

A default value is ``.pioenvs`` that means that folder is located in the root of
project.

There is a ``$PROJECT_HASH`` template variable. You can use it in a path.
It will by replaced by a SHA1[0:10] hash of a full project path.
This is very useful to declare a global storage for project artifacts.
For example, ``/tmp/pio-build/$PROJECT_HASH`` (Unix) or
``%TEMP%/pio-build/$PROJECT_HASH`` (Windows). You can set a global build
directory using system environment variable :envvar:`PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR`.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_BUILD_DIR`.

.. note::
    If you have any problems with building your Project environments which
    are defined in :ref:`projectconf`, then **TRY TO DELETE** this folder. In
    this situation you will remove all cached files without any risk.

.. _projectconf_pio_include_dir:

``include_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A path to project's headers files. PlatformIO uses it for :ref:`cmd_run`
command. A default value is ``include`` that means that folder is located in the
root of project. This path will be added to ``CPPPATH`` of build environment.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_INCLUDE_DIR`.

.. _projectconf_pio_src_dir:

``src_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^

A path to project's source directory. PlatformIO uses it for :ref:`cmd_run`
command. A default value is ``src`` that means that folder is located in the
root of project.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_SRC_DIR`.

.. note::
    This option is useful for people who migrate from Arduino/Energia IDEs where
    source directory should have the same name like the main source file.
    See `example <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-examples/tree/develop/atmelavr/arduino-own-src_dir>`__ project with own source directory.

.. _projectconf_pio_lib_dir:

``lib_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^

You can put here your own/private libraries. The source code of each library
should be placed in separate directory, like
``lib/private_lib/[here are source files]``. This directory has the highest
priority for :ref:`ldf`.

A default value is ``lib`` that means that folder is located in the root of
project.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_LIB_DIR`.

For example, see how can be organized ``Foo`` and ``Bar`` libraries:

.. code::

    |--lib
    |  |--Bar
    |  |  |--docs
    |  |  |--examples
    |  |  |--src
    |  |     |- Bar.c
    |  |     |- Bar.h
    |  |--Foo
    |  |  |- Foo.c
    |  |  |- Foo.h
    |- platformio.ini
    |--src
       |- main.c


Then in ``src/main.c`` you should use:

.. code-block:: c

    #include <Foo.h>
    #include <Bar.h>

    // rest H/C/CPP code

PlatformIO will find your libraries automatically, configure preprocessor's
include paths and build them.

.. _projectconf_pio_libdeps_dir:

``libdeps_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Internal storage where :ref:`librarymanager` will install project dependencies
(:ref:`projectconf_lib_deps`). A default value is ``.piolibdeps`` that means
that folder is located in the root of project.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_LIBDEPS_DIR`.

.. _projectconf_global_lib_extra_dirs:

``lib_extra_dirs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 3.2

A list with extra storages for a project where :ref:`ldf` will look for libraries.

This option has the same behavior as :ref:`projectconf_lib_extra_dirs` option
for a specific build environment defined in ``[env:]`` section. The main
difference is that the option which is defined in ``[platofrmio]`` section
will be extra applied automatically for all ``[env:]`` sections.

For the possible values and examples please follow to :ref:`projectconf_lib_extra_dirs`.

.. _projectconf_pio_data_dir:

``data_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data directory to store contents and :ref:`platform_espressif_uploadfs`.
A default value is ``data`` that means that folder is located in the root of
project.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_DATA_DIR`.

.. _projectconf_pio_test_dir:

``test_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Directory where :ref:`unit_testing` engine will look for the tests.
A default value is ``test`` that means that folder is located in the root of
project.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_TEST_DIR`.

.. _projectconf_pio_boards_dir:

``boards_dir``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Custom board settings per project. You can change this path with your own.
A default value is ``boards`` that means that folder is located in the root of
project.

By default, PlatformIO looks for boards in this order:

1. Project :ref:`projectconf_pio_boards_dir`
2. Global :ref:`projectconf_pio_home_dir`/boards
3. Development platform :ref:`projectconf_pio_home_dir`/platforms/\*/boards.

This option can be overridden by global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_BOARDS_DIR`.
