``platform``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type: ``Package Specification`` | Multiple: ``No``

Specify a development platform that provides integration of vendor-specific
boards (development kits, MCUs), high-level frameworks, and SDKs.
See :ref:`cmd_pkg_install_specifications` for details.

`PlatformIO Registry <https://registry.platformio.org>`__ allows you to explore
supported development platforms, boards, frameworks, and toolchains.

For the advanced platform configuration, please check the :ref:`platforms` documentation.

Example of using a `Espressif 32 development platform <https://registry.platformio.org/platforms/platformio/espressif32>`_:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:recommended_specification]
    ; allow backwards-compatible new functionality and bug-fixes
    platform = espressif32@^3.5.0

    [env:allow_only_bug_fixes]
    platform = espressif32@~3.5.0

    [env:exact_version]
    platform = espressif32@3.5.0

    [env:latest_version]
    ; not recommended as it does not ensure that 
    ; - builds are repeatable
    ; - all developers who checkout the project wil build against the same platform version
    platform = espressif32

    [env:development_verion_by_git]
    platform = https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32.git

    [env:custom_git_branch]
    platform = https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32.git#master

    [env:specific_git_commit]
    platform = https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32.git#f8340a2081a31c2ac8ed2b16907f2a21dc8897d4


.. note::
    We highly recommend pinning the platform to a verison.
    See :ref:`cmd_pkg_install_requirements` for details.
