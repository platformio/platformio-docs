    Please make sure to read :ref:`librarymanager_dependencies` guide first.

Specify project dependencies using :ref:`cmd_pkg_install_specifications`
that should be installed automatically to the
:ref:`projectconf_pio_libdeps_dir` before environment processing. 
Can be left blank.

If you have multiple build environments that depend on the same libraries,
you can use :ref:`projectconf_section_env` or :ref:`projectconf_interpolation`
to use the common configuration.

Check the `PlatformIO Registry <https://registry.platformio.org>`__
for the available libraries and the installation instructions.
