.. _projectconf_pio_lib_dir:

``lib_dir``
-----------

Type: ``DirPath`` | Multiple: ``No`` | Default: "<Project>/``lib``"

You can put your own/private libraries here. The source code of each library
should be placed in separate directory, like
``lib/private_lib/[here are source files]``. This directory has the highest
priority for :ref:`ldf`.

The default value is ``lib``, meaning a ``lib`` directory located in
the root of the project.

This option can also be configured by the global environment variable
:envvar:`PLATFORMIO_LIB_DIR`.

For example, see how the ``Foo`` and ``Bar`` libraries are organized:

.. code::

    |--lib
    |  |--Bar
    |  |  |--docs
    |  |  |--examples
    |  |  |--src
    |  |     |- Bar.c
    |  |     |- Bar.h
    |  |--Foo
    |  |  |- Foo.c
    |  |  |- Foo.h
    |- platformio.ini
    |--src
       |- main.c


Then in ``src/main.c`` you should use:

.. code-block:: c

    #include <Foo.h>
    #include <Bar.h>

    // rest of H/C/CPP code

And platformio.ini file [env:] should include:

-- code::
    lib_deps = 
        Bar
        Foo

PlatformIO will find your libraries automatically, configure the
preprocessor's include paths and build them.
