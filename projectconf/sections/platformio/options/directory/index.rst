Directory options
-----------------

.. note::
    You can specify relative paths for the directory option:

    * The ``~`` (tilde) symbol will automatically expand to the user's home directory
    * Using ``../`` or ``..\`` allows you to navigate up one folder level.

    Additionally, you have the option to employ :ref:`projectconf_interpolation`
    for paths.
