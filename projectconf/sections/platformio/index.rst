Section ``[platformio]``
------------------------

.. contents::
    :local:

The ``platformio`` section in the platformio.ini file is used for overriding the
default configuration options for :ref:`piocore`.

.. note::
    Relative path is allowed for directory option:

    * ``~`` will be expanded to user's home directory
    * ``../`` or ``..\`` go up to one folder

    There is a ``$PROJECT_HASH`` template variable. You can use it in a directory
    path. It will by replaced by a SHA1[0:10] hash of the full project path.
    This is very useful to declare a global storage for project workspaces.
    For example, ``/tmp/pio-workspaces/$PROJECT_HASH`` (Unix) or
    ``${sysenv.TEMP}/pio-workspaces/$PROJECT_HASH`` (Windows).
    You can set a global workspace directory using the system environment
    variable :envvar:`PLATFORMIO_WORKSPACE_DIR`.

    See the available directory ``***_dir`` options below.
