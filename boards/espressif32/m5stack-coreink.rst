M5Stack-Core Ink
================

.. contents::

Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_espressif32`: Espressif Systems is a privately held fabless semiconductor company. They provide wireless communications and Wi-Fi chips which are widely used in mobile devices and the Internet of Things applications.

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - ESP32
  * - **Frequency**
    - 240MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 4MB
  * - **RAM**
    - 320KB
  * - **Vendor**
    - `M5Stack <http://www.m5stack.com?utm_source=platformio.org&utm_medium=docs>`__


Configuration
-------------

Please use ``m5stack-coreink`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:m5stack-coreink]
  platform = espressif32
  board = m5stack-coreink

You can override default M5Stack-Core Ink settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `m5stack-coreink.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32/blob/master/boards/m5stack-coreink.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:m5stack-coreink]
  platform = espressif32
  board = m5stack-coreink

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = esp32

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 240000000L


Uploading
---------
M5Stack-Core Ink supports the following uploading protocols:

* ``espota``
* ``esptool``

Default protocol is ``esptool``

You can change upload protocol using :ref:`projectconf_upload_protocol` option:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:m5stack-coreink]
  platform = espressif32
  board = m5stack-coreink

  upload_protocol = esptool

Debugging
---------
:ref:`piodebug` currently does not support M5Stack-Core Ink board.
