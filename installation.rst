Installation
============

.. note::

    Please note that you do not need to install :ref:`piocore` if you are going
    to use :ref:`pioide`. :ref:`piocore` is built into
    PlatformIO IDE and you will be able to use it within PlatformIO IDE Terminal.

    If you need :ref:`piocore` outside PlatformIO IDE, please :ref:`faq_install_shell_commands`.

**PlatformIO Core** is written in `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD and *ARM*-based credit-card sized
computers (`Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org>`_,
`BeagleBone <http://beagleboard.org>`_, `CubieBoard <http://cubieboard.org>`_,
`Samsung ARTIK <https://www.artik.io>`_, etc.).

System requirements
-------------------

:Operating System: Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, Linux ARMv6+
:Python Interpreter:

    Python 2.7 is required. PlatformIO **does not** support Python 3.

    .. attention::
        **Windows Users**: Please `Download the latest Python 2.7
        <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and install it.
        **DON'T FORGET** to select ``Add python.exe to Path`` feature on the
        "Customize" stage, otherwise Python Package Manager ``pip`` command
        will not be available.

:Terminal Application:

    All commands below should be executed in
    `Command-line <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface>`_
    application (Terminal). For macOS and Linux OS - *Terminal* application,
    for Windows OS â€“ ``cmd.exe`` application.


:Access to Serial Ports (USB/UART):

    **Windows Users:** Please check that you have correctly installed USB
    driver from board manufacturer

    **Linux Users**:

    * Ubuntu/Debian users may need to add own "username" to the "dialout"
      group if they are not "root", doing this issuing a
      ``sudo usermod -a -G dialout yourusername``.
    * Install "udev" rules file `99-platformio-udev.rules <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/blob/develop/scripts/99-platformio-udev.rules>`_
      (an instruction is located in the file).
    * Raspberry Pi users, please read this article
      `Enable serial port on Raspberry Pi <https://hallard.me/enable-serial-port-on-raspberry-pi/>`__.


Installation Methods
--------------------

Please *choose ONE of* the following methods:

    :local:

Python Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest stable version of PlatformIO may be installed or upgraded via
Python Package Manager (`pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_) as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U platformio

If ``pip`` command is not available run ``easy_install pip`` or use
:ref:`installation_installer_script` which will install ``pip`` and
``platformio`` automatically.

Note that you may run into permissions issues running these commands. You have
a few options here:

* Run with ``sudo`` to install PlatformIO and dependencies globally
* Specify the `pip install --user <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide.html#user-installs>`_
  option to install local to your user
* Run the command in a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`_ local to a
  specific project working set.

.. _installation_installer_script:

Installer Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Super-Quick (Mac / Linux)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

To install or upgrade *PlatformIO* paste that at a *Terminal* prompt
(**MAY require** administrator access ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio/develop/scripts/get-platformio.py)"


Local Download (Mac / Linux / Windows)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To install or upgrade *PlatformIO*, download (save as...)
`get-platformio.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio/develop/scripts/get-platformio.py>`_
script. Then run the following (**MAY require** administrator access ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: bash

    # change directory to folder where is located downloaded "get-platformio.py"
    cd /path/to/dir/where/is/located/get-platformio.py/script

    # run it
    python get-platformio.py


On *Windows OS* it may look like:

.. code-block:: bash

    # change directory to folder where is located downloaded "get-platformio.py"
    cd C:\path\to\dir\where\is\located\get-platformio.py\script

    # run it
    C:\Python27\python.exe get-platformio.py


macOS Homebrew
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest stable version of PlatformIO may be installed or upgraded via
macOS Homebrew Packages Manager (`brew <http://brew.sh/>`_) as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

Full Guide
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Check a ``python`` version (only Python 2.7 is supported):

.. code-block:: bash

    python --version

*Windows Users* only:

    * `Download Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and install it.
    * Add to PATH system variable ``;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;`` and reopen *Command Prompt* (``cmd.exe``) application. Please read this article `How to set the path and environment variables in Windows <http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm>`_.

2. Install a ``platformio`` and related packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U platformio

If your computer does not recognize ``pip`` command, try to install it first
using `these instructions <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_.

For upgrading ``platformio`` to the latest version:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U platformio

.. _installation_develop:

Development Version
-------------------

.. warning::
    If you use :ref:`pioide`, please enable development version:

    * **Atom**: "Menu PlatformIO: Settings > PlatformIO IDE > Use development
      version of PlatformIO Core"
    * **VSCode**: Set ```platformio-ide.useDevelopmentPIOCore`` to ``true`` in
      Settings.

Install the latest PlatformIO from the ``develop`` branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    # uninstall existing version
    pip uninstall platformio

    # install the latest development version of PlatformIO
    pip install -U https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/archive/develop.zip

If you want to be up-to-date with the latest ``develop`` version of PlatformIO,
then you need to re-install PlatformIO each time if you see the new commits in
`PlatformIO GitHub repository (branch: develop) <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/commits/develop>`_.

To revert to the latest stable version

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall platformio
    pip install -U platformio

.. _piocore_uninstall:

Uninstall PIO Core and dependent packages
-----------------------------------------

* Uninstall PIO Core tool

    .. code-block:: bash

        # uninstall standalone PIO Core installed via `pip`
        pip uninstall platformio

        # uninstall Homebrew's PIO Core (only macOS users if you installed it via Homebrew before)
        brew uninstall platformio

* Dependent packages, global libraries are installed to ``$HOME/.platformio``
  folder (in user's HOME directory). Just remove it.

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. note::
    **Linux OS**: Don't forget to install "udev" rules file
    `99-platformio-udev.rules <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/blob/develop/scripts/99-platformio-udev.rules>`_ (an instruction is located in the file).
