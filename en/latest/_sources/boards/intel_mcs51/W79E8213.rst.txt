Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_intel_mcs51`: The Intel MCS-51 (commonly termed 8051) is an internally Harvard architecture, complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set, single chip microcontroller (uC) series developed by Intel in 1980 for use in embedded systems.

Configuration
-------------

Please use ``W79E8213`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:W79E8213]
  platform = intel_mcs51
  board = W79E8213

You can override default Generic W79E8213 settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `W79E8213.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-intel_mcs51/blob/master/boards/W79E8213.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:W79E8213]
  platform = intel_mcs51
  board = W79E8213

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = w79e8213

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 20000000L

Debugging
---------
:ref:`piodebug` currently does not support Generic W79E8213 board.
