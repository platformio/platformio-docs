Shippable
=========

`Shippable <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shippable>`_ is a hosted cloud
platform that provides hosted continuous integration, deployment, and testing
to `GitHub <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub>`_ and
`BitBucket <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket>`_ repositories.
Shippable's continuous integration service is built using Docker.

Shippable is configured by adding a file named ``shippable.yml``, which is a
`YAML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ format text file, to the root
directory of the GitHub repository or you can use your Travis CI configuration
file ``.travis.yml``.

Shippable automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a
repository that is using Shippable, and each time this happens, it will
try to build the project using :ref:`cmd_ci` command. This includes commits to
all branches, not just to the master branch. Shippable will also build and run
pull requests. When that process has completed, it will notify a developer in
the way it has been configured to do so â€” for example, by sending an email
containing the build results (showing success or failure), or by posting a
message on an IRC channel. It can be configured to build project on a range of
different :ref:`platforms`.

Integration
-----------

Put ``shippable.yml`` or ``.travis.yml`` to the root directory of your repository. The
contents of this file depends on the project you want to add. There are two possible
ways of running PlatformIO in CI services:

Using :ref:`cmd_run` command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This variant is default choice for native PlatformIO projects:

.. code-block:: yaml

    language: python
    python:
        - "3.11"

    install:
        - pip install -U platformio

    script:
        - pio run -e <ID_1> -e <ID_2> -e <ID_N>


Using :ref:`cmd_ci` command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This variant is more convenient when project is written as a library (when there are
examples or testing code) as it has additional options for specifying extra libraries
and boards from command line interface:

.. code-block:: yaml

    language: python
    python:
        - "3.11"

    env:
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC=path/to/source/file.c
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC=path/to/source/file.ino
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC=path/to/source/directory

    install:
        - pip install -U platformio

    script:
        - pio ci --board=<ID_1> --board=<ID_2> --board=<ID_N>


Examples
--------

1. Integration for `USB_Host_Shield_2.0 <https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0>`_
   project. The ``shippable.yml`` or ``.travis.yml`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    language: python
    python:
        - "3.11"

    env:
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC=examples/Bluetooth/PS3SPP/PS3SPP.ino
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC=examples/pl2303/pl2303_gps/pl2303_gps.ino

    install:
        - pip install -U platformio
        - wget https://github.com/xxxajk/spi4teensy3/archive/master.zip -O /tmp/spi4teensy3.zip
        - unzip /tmp/spi4teensy3.zip -d /tmp

    script:
        - pio ci --lib="." --lib="/tmp/spi4teensy3-master" --board=uno --board=teensy31 --board=due
