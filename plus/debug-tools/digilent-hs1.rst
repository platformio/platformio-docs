Configuration
-------------

You can configure debugging tool using :ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in
:ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = digilent-hs1

If you would like to use this tool for firmware uploading, please change
upload protocol:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = digilent-hs1
    upload_protocol = digilent-hs1
