The ESP USB Bridge is an ESP-IDF project utilizing an ESP32-S2 (or optionally,
an ESP32-S3) chip to create a bridge between a computer (PC) and a target
microcontroller (MCU). It can serve as a replacement for USB-to-UART chips
(e.g. CP210x).
Official reference can be found `here <https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb-bridge?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=docs>`__.

Configuration
-------------

You can configure debugging tool using :ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in
:ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = esp-bridge

If you would like to use this tool for firmware uploading, please change
upload protocol:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = esp-bridge
    upload_protocol = esp-bridge

More options:

* :ref:`projectconf_section_env_debug`
* :ref:`projectconf_section_env_upload`
