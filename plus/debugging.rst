PIO Unified Debugger
====================

**It Simply Works. Easier than ever before!**

.. note::

  `Demo, discussions, request a support for new hardware. <https://community.platformio.org/t/finally-pio-unified-debugger-comes-to-vscode/4091>`_

PIO Plus offers a unique debugging experience for productive embedded
development. Using our multi-board and multi-architecture programming
experience, we simplified the debugging process in the same way. A zero
debugging configuration with support for the most popular debugging probes
and compatibility between IDEs and OS.

Developers can finally forget about complex UI windows which they need to
pre-configure before a simple “Hello World!” debugging session. No need to
know any aspects about the debugging server or how to configure it. PIO Plus
Unified Debugger does this complex work automatically having a rich
configuration database per each board and debugging probe.

Just select a board, connect debugging probe (if a board does not have
onboard debugging interface), specify it in PlatformIO project configuration
file “platformio.ini”, and a project is ready for 1-Click debugging.


* "1-click" solution, zero configuration
* Support over 300+ embedded boards (see below)
* Multiple architectures and development platforms
* Windows, MacOS, Linux
* Built-in into :ref:`ide_atom` and :ref:`ide_vscode`
* Integration with :ref:`ide_eclipse` and :ref:`ide_sublimetext`

You should have :ref:`pioaccount` to work with |PIODebug|.
A registration is **FREE**.


.. hint::
  In our experience, :ref:`ide_vscode` has the best system performance,
  modern interface for |PIODebug|, and users have found it easier to get started.
  Key debugging features of :ref:`ide_vscode`:

  - Local, Global, and Static Variable Explorer
  - Conditional Breakpoints
  - Expressions and Watchpoints
  - Generic Registers
  - Peripheral Registers
  - Memory Viewer
  - Disassembly
  - Multi-thread support
  - A hot restart of an active debugging session
